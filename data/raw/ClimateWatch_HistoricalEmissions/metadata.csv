The scenario in which country reported data (CRF, BUR, UNFCCC) is prioritized over third party data (CDIAC, FAO, Andrew, EDGAR, BP) is used on Climate Watch. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Waste is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Due to data availability and methodological issues, version 2.2 of the PRIMAP-hist dataset does not include emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF).

The definition format of data for emissions/removals from the forestry sector is different for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Note 2: Base year data in the data interface relate to the base year under the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). The base year under the Convention is defined slightly different than the base year under the Kyoto Protocol. An exception is made for European Union (KP) whereby the base year under the Kyoto Protocol is displayed. Note 3: Some non-Annex I Parties submitted their GHG inventory data using the format of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in reporting GHG emissions/removals.

For example, emissions data for Russia are not available prior to 1990. To generate a more complete and useful time series we have estimated emissions for Russia prior to 1990 by assuming that the share of Russiaâ€™s emissions in the USSR was constant up until 1990.
